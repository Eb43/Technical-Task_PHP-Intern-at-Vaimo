Result:
Script simulates simple elevator interface in 11-story building. The user is shown the currrent floor and prompted to input desired floor. Script checks if the input is an integer from 0 to 10 and shows information that user got to a desired floor. If user types integer outside 0-10 range or not an integer script shows related message. After each input user gets a question if he wants to continue. If user selects N or makes any other input except Y script wishes a nice day to the user and stops its work. 

Scrip made with PHP version 7.4.1
